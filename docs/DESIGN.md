# Design

My Dotfiles are designed to allow you to work without distraction.

### Basic goals and principles

- **Naturalness** — Everything important should be as few keypresses as possible away from you, and you shouldn't have to think about what you're doing.

- **Economy** — Programs should be simple and light on system resources and highly extensible.

- **Keyboard/vim-centrality** — All terminal programs (and other programs) use vim keys when possible.

## Animations

There are no animations or distracting eye-candy, everything happens instantly.
