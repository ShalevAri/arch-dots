# Shalev's Dotfiles

> [!WARNING]
> My Dotfiles are still a work-in-progress and may be a little hacky at times.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is not meant for beginners.
>
> My Dotfiles are designed for minimalism and pure speed, allowing you to focus on your work with no distractions.
>
> It is expected that you know the basics of Linux and how things generally work, as simple things won't be explained and instructions will be tailored to experienced users.
>
> See the [Design Document](docs/DESIGN.md) for more information.
